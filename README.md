# Holographic-Classification-for-microplastic-particles-
## Abstract:
Microplastic pollution is a global issue. Recent years of study have proven significant impact of microplastics to aquatic life and terrestrail beings. Majority of these undetectable yet harmful plastics are estimated to have ocean bodies as their origin. Current advancements in technology doesnt provide with feasible techniques to detect them. Present spectroscopic and microscopic methods are time consuming and not cost effective. And yet, these techniques are ineffective in capturing sufficient information. This project uses holographic image dataset for classifying microplastics. 
The advantages of holographic images over other techniques are :
#### 1. #3D information:
Holographic pictures, as opposed to conventional 2D microscopy or spectroscopy, record 3D information of the microplastic particles. Differentiating between certain microplastic kinds that could seem same in a 2D picture can be made easier with the use of this extra information.
#### 2. Analysis that isn't destructive: 
Holographic imaging is a non-destructive method that doesn't involve physically modifying or labeling the microplastics, which is advantageous for maintaining the samples' integrity for further examination.
#### 3. Automation potential: 
Using machine learning algorithms trained to recognize certain characteristics of various microplastic kinds, the image analysis procedure for holographic data may be automated. Comparing this automation to the human analytical methods often used in previous procedures might result in a categorization that is quicker and more accurate.

## Proposed Architecture :
 The collected holographic images dataset from https://github.com/ymzhu19eee/dataset_microplastics is trained on different convoutional neural network architectures(regular CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV6) and the results obtained are jusitifed. The decided model is VGG16.

## Future enhancemets :
A bigger dataset can be collected, precision score of the VGG16 can be improved.
